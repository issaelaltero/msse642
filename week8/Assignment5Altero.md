## PR Merge Conflicts?

Did you run into merge conflicts?

I did. I did not have write access to another team member's repo, which I do not own.

Fix Options:

 Option 1: Fork and Push to Your Own Repo (Recommended if you donâ€™t have access)

 Option 2: Get Permission to Push

 I created PRs with Option 1 to collab with other team members allowing me not wait for their written permissions.
